## Portal Seekers Game Client (Full Source)

**Genre**: Online multiplayer asymmetric action game.

**Date**: Sep 2017 - Jan 2018 

**Team size**: 2 

**Game Description**: Portal Seekers can be played between two players (1vs1) and up to five (1vs4) where one
player controls a Guardian and the rest of the players control Seekers. The game is set in a maze-like and dense forest, the objective of the seekers is to escape the
forest. For that, they will need to use the portal. To open the portal, the seekers must charge and
activate the four pillars scattered across the forest. The pillars will need energy to be charged, for
that the seekers will have to bring orbs that spawn randomly across the map and take them to the
pillars. The Guardianâ€™s objective is to prevent the Seekers from opening the portal and escape the
forest.

**My role**: I was responsible for all the network communication. P2P model with UDP connections for gameplay and client-server with TCP connection for matchmaking.
